A custom fork of the Spider Solitaire built for my granny to play on Linux.
She can't find any of the built-in solitaire games as good as she used to have them on Windows, so I found this one and slightly tweaked it.

Changes from the original:

- Ditched floating UI controls in favour of an easy to read massive top navbar
- Translated everything into Russian (another reason my granny hates those foreign solitaire games on Linux)
- Added PWA + offline support to make it playable without an internet connection
- Slightly changed the background
- Removed font-awesome

Just a simple Spider Solitaire clone, written in javascript. 
The project utilizes [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/) for the canvas/drawing and [howler](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) for the sound effects.

**Feel free to embed this game on your own website. I only ask that you credit me somehow (a link to this github page would be good).**

The [original version of the game](http://fuzzley.info/spider/) is hosted on http://fuzzley.info/spider/. You may have to clear your cache to see changes. If you find any problems, or if you'd like to see a feature implemented, please let me know :).

Have fun!
